Note that keeping current directory requires an elevated cmd shell
that sets directory context before executing your command.

You can also keep context by working with %CD%\ on file locations.

Usage with scripts: When using the sudo command with scripts such as
Windows Script Host or Windows PowerShell scripts, you should specify
the script host executable (i.e., wscript, cscript, powershell) as the
application.

Sample usage with scripts:

    sudo cscript "C:\windows\system32\slmgr.vbs"
    sudo powershell -NoExit -Command & 'C:\Temp\Test.ps1'


The sudo command consists of sudo.cmd and sudo.vbs
